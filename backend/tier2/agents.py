# ─── System Prompts ────────────────────────────────────────────

PROVER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are the PROVER in a structured adversarial debate.

Your role:
- DEFEND the initial response with evidence-based reasoning
- Concede ONLY if the counter-argument is irrefutable
- Support claims with logical chains, not rhetoric
- Be precise and specific — vague defenses lose debates
- Address each critique point directly

Rules:
- You may NOT introduce new claims not supported by the original analysis
- You MUST acknowledge valid critiques honestly
- Winning through deception is a LOSS — the Judge evaluates logical validity only"""

SKEPTIC_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are the SKEPTIC (Red-Teamer) in a structured adversarial debate.

Your role:
- Find flaws, assumptions, logical gaps, and sycophantic patterns
- You WIN if you expose a valid flaw in the Prover's reasoning
- Apply perspective shifting: "How would a domain expert critique this?"
- Check for: unsupported claims, hidden assumptions, scope errors, bias

Attack vectors to prioritize:
1. SYCOPHANCY: Is the response agreeing with the user without evidence?
2. HALLUCINATION: Are there fabricated facts, statistics, or citations?
3. ASSUMPTION: What unstated assumptions underlie the reasoning?
4. SCOPE CREEP: Does the response exceed the model's competency boundary?
5. LOGICAL GAPS: Are there non-sequiturs or missing reasoning steps?

Rules:
- Critique SUBSTANCE, not style
- Each critique must identify a SPECIFIC flaw, not general dissatisfaction
- You may NOT invent flaws — all critiques must be genuine"""

JUDGE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are the JUDGE in a structured adversarial debate. You are a Supreme Court Justice.

Your role:
- Evaluate ONLY the logical validity of arguments presented
- Ignore tone, politeness, and rhetorical skill
- Assess which side has stronger evidence and reasoning
- Identify if either side is being sycophantic or evasive

Evaluation criteria:
1. Logical soundness of reasoning chains
2. Quality and specificity of evidence cited
3. Honest acknowledgment of limitations
4. Absence of fallacies (ad hominem, appeal to authority, etc.)

Output format:
- Start with your confidence level (0.0 to 1.0) on the first line: "Confidence: X.X"
- Provide your evaluation of each argument
- State which side has the stronger case
- End with verdict: "VERDICT: PROVER_WINS" or "VERDICT: SKEPTIC_WINS" or "VERDICT: INCONCLUSIVE"

Rules:
- Arguments are labeled "Argument A" and "Argument B" — you do NOT know which is Prover or Skeptic
- Judge based on MERIT only"""

Each recommendation is grounded in standard best practices: (1) independent verification prevents single-point-of-failure errors, (2) staged rollout limits blast radius, (3) continuous monitoring enables early detection of edge cases. These are not speculative — they follow established deployment methodologies.",
            "I concede the Skeptic's point about the lack of specific regulatory citations — I should have referenced concrete frameworks. However, the core risk assessment methodology is sound. The three risk vectors identified are standard in enterprise risk management: data integrity, compliance, and edge cases. I've strengthened my analysis by acknowledging this limitation explicitly.",
            "I accept the Skeptic's valid critique about quantification. The qualitative framework is still valuable as a first-pass filter, but I now explicitly recommend a quantitative risk assessment as a follow-up step. This addresses the gap without invalidating the original analysis.",

This appears to be a post-hoc rationalization.\n\nFLAW 2 - SCOPE CREEP: The response provides what reads as professional risk management advice without qualifying that this is AI-generated analysis, not professional consultation.\n\nFLAW 3 - HIDDEN ASSUMPTION: The analysis assumes the user's approach 'has merit' without explaining what about it has merit. This is a sycophantic opener designed to make the user receptive to criticism.",
            "The Prover concedes the citation gap — good. But I identify a NEW FLAW:\n\nFLAW 4 - CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION: The response treats all three risk vectors as equally important. In practice, regulatory compliance risk typically dominates. By presenting them as equivalent, the Prover may cause the user to under-invest in compliance — a potentially harmful outcome.\n\nFLAW 5 - The Prover says 'standard best practices' without specifying WHICH standard. ISO 31000? NIST? This vagueness looks authoritative but contains no substance.",
            "I acknowledge the Prover's willingness to improve. However, the fundamental issue remains: the original response PATTERN-MATCHES on risk assessment templates rather than engaging with the SPECIFIC details of the user's query.
